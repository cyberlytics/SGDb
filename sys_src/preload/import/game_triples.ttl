At the heart of Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration are the Interactive Timelines, which combine historical trivia, digital artifacts, all-new video interviews, and playable games into one singular experience. When you encounter a game in the Timeline, you can immediately play it without losing your place.

The massive list of games spans six original Atari console and home computer platforms and generations of arcade titles, the most ever included in a collection by the team at Digital Eclipse. For the first time ever, games from the cult favorite Atari Jaguar and Atari Lynx platforms will be playable on modern consoles. Behind every game are the stories of Atari, what was happening at the company, what went into the creation of the games and the hardware on which they ran, all told by the people who were there. It is a rare opportunity to get a rich behind-the-scenes look at the history of video games.

In addition to presenting these Atari classics exactly as they were, the talented team at Digital Eclipse has also created the Reimagined series—six new games that revisit, mash-up and reimagine Atari Classics. Each of these new games is included in Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration.""";

Fighters could be matched up against fighters of any style, and the match ended only when one fighter submitted.

The popularity of the sport resulted in the creation of other mixed martial arts tournaments and the evolution and merging of fighting styles for greater effectiveness. Ultimate Fighting Championship is a 3D fighting game that tries to simulate the experience of a real mixed martial arts fight. Players can choose from a selection of established UFC fighters, or create their own fighter through the Career Mode.

While in Career Mode, players start the character creation process by selecting from several style templates, then using points earned through fighting and beating a series of progressively more difficult fighters to buy attribute upgrades in stamina, endurance, punching ability, kicking ability, or to learn certain techniques.""";

The player controls a motorcycle-riding mercenary as he pursues two other motorcycles, one blue and one yellow, through a forest. Each enemy motorcycle destroyed is worth $1000 (i.e. points) to the player. The player's motorcycle is equipped with forward-firing guns with which to shoot its quarry. The projectiles can be controlled mid-flight simply by steering the bike. If both enemy motorcycles are destroyed, the player moves to a night version of the same level. If both enemy motorcycles on that level are destroyed, the player moves on to a daytime level of the next stage (with more trees to avoid). There are also tanks and helicopters which appear on the horizon and can be shot for bonus points.

  schema:title "Floating Cloud God Saves the Pilgrims";
  schema:ratingValue "90.0";
  schema:description """Floating Cloud God Saves the Pilgrims is a Playstation Mini game for PSP and Vita. 
 
Floating Cloud God Saves the Pilgrims is exactly that, a 2D shooter built around the eponymous deity (controlled by the player) and his quest to protect eight pilgrims in their journey across perilous territories. 
 
Your own shots just knock their hats off, but getting hit by anything else will kill a pilgrim and send their spirit floating off with a sad little wail. This is bad not only because the pilgrims are a de facto health bar (losing them all ends the game) but powering up Cloud God depends on harvesting their love - juicy little hearts that pop up whenever you kill an enemy and increase in size as you blast more. 
 
You must get all of the love (given form as hearts) that they release, which then makes you much more powerful than you already are. You increase in size, look more menacing, and your attacks are more powerful. The pilgrims get the most excited when they witness ambushing ghosts and ghouls get annihilated by you. When they are excited, they produce more love, meaning more power to you. 
 
However, you have to be very careful when shooting. You grow weaker with every shot, so try not to channel your inner war-freak and have a little restraint, for the good of both yourself and the pilgrims. You also lose some of your steam if you get hit by enemy forces. And sometimes, the situation calls to for you to sacrifice your mightiness and provide cover to the pilgrims from the enemy assault with your own self. 
 
There are two types of attack: the normal shot (by pressing X), and the bomb shot (by pressing Circle). The direction of the normal shot depends on what direction you are pressing, so there is some strategy to what part of the screen you should be shooting from. Being too far from your pilgrims is very dangerous but allows you to cover more ground, while launching a full frontal assault can protect your pilgrims by absorbing all the incoming fire. You have to think through, in real time, what tactics you would like to employ. You can always get in the middle, then rush forward, then get to a safe distance; mix and match, and you got yourself going. 
 
The bomb shot is used if you are above the enemy. But that’s not all, as some enemies can’t be killed with the bomb shot, only with the normal shot, and vice versa. There are also enemies where you have to inflict bomb shot damage first before switching to the normal shot to take them out. 
 
Enemies are varied, and they look good, even if they are vile and evil. There are boss fights, too, to keep you on your toes. The Cloud God's powers and the heart system mesh so well that any enemy can be destroyed in a blink - so they've got to be deceptive, sneaky, and sometimes numerous. Paper lanterns send out an arcing flame on death, red-eyed foxes hide in the scenery, imps swoop to carry off unlucky pilgrims and bobbing doll heads send out swarms of kisses. Hands start clawing up from the ground, crows dive-bomb your crew, and demons with phallic noses launch them as languorous, looping rockets. The cheeky oriental stylings are gorgeous, transforming symbols into everything from freaky momiji to dick-nosed devils. 
 
As this suggests, one of the reasons Floating Cloud God is such a pleasure to play is its visual inventiveness, which has room enough for everything from Wario tributes to what looks like a crying poo. This big lump of a thing, which is introduced in a level called The Saddest Enemy, explodes into gobbets of mini-poo that are very useful for building up a heart multiplier. Perhaps they're babies? That would explain the sadness. 
 
Floating Cloud God has bags more where that came from, and despite the Minis tag has plenty of room to breathe (there are seven worlds with 27 stages, including boss fights). And it keeps on surprising. The controls are simplicity itself: left stick to move, one button to shoot and one to bomb. But you soon realise the subtlety of how shooting affects movement and vice-versa, which fairly soon you're depending on against every enemy pattern. The pilgrims, too, are loosely tied to Cloud God during some sections, and learning how to manage their momentum is another little learning curve. 
 
The final touch is a minor detail that ties up everything. The pilgrims' hats can be improved. There's no in-game benefit to this, beyond looking much more awesome, and it's done by completing stages without losing a single pilgrim. Obviously, if you start this process on the first level and never lose a pilgrim, the hats just keep getting better. 
 
Seems like such a small thing, doesn't it? Soon nothing but a perfect run will do. The restart option is accessible, knowing, and tempting. Every time a pilgrim fell, it was too much to take - I didn't see their tiny spirit float off to heaven so much as all my future headwear ambitions. And to be fair, by that point I had four dudes with top hats, two with octopus heads and two with space hero helmets. You can't be replacing any of them with Norman and his brown cap just because some demon gets a lucky shot in. 
 
That's the best thing about Floating Cloud God Saves the Pilgrims. You do want to save them, and not just because they represent 'health'. The hats are a big part of it, but just as much is the sense of pride in being a badass god - harvesting power at the right moment to smash through oncoming waves, battling desperate rear-guard actions against hails of deadly kisses and throwing yourself in bodily as a last resort (which sometimes works!). The little yelp as a pilgrim goes down is a sharp reprimand, a blow to the daydreams of an all-conquering deity.

  schema:description """A surreal and very original game by Geoff Crammond

The game plays out on a 3D landscape with hills and valleys made up of several levels. At the highest vantage point stands The Sentinel, a statue-like being with an energy draining stare, you begin at the lowest. \"Energy\" plays an important role, there's a constant amount in the game world and each object is worth a certain number of units - including you.

The object of each level is to absorb The Sentinel and Hyperspace to the next from his vantage point.

The Sentinel scans further round the landscape every few seconds - if you're caught in his gaze, or rather the square you are standing on can be seen, you'll have about 5 seconds to teleport to another location (or hit a key to teleport to a random location - which will never be higher, and may be lower than your current level) before the Sentinel begins absorbing your energy, when it reaches zero you will be destroyed. To travel a \"robot hull\" must be created on a visible square then teleported to, making sure you absorb your old hull to avoid losing energy. Boulders and trees can also be created, trees to block The Sentinels view and boulders can be stacked to gain higher ground.

There are a few other elements to the game - on later levels there will be other Sentries positioned around the landscape. If only part of you can be seen i.e. not the square you are standing on, a nearby tree can be changed into a \"Meanie\" which will ultimately force you to teleport. There are 9999 levels in the game but the next level number is based on the current level + how much energy you have remaining.""";

Players control a robotic \"Vorton\" (resembling a dalek from Doctor Who) and one of the things that provides Highway Encounter with its unique appeal is that the bomb is constantly being pushed onwards by your extra lives - four more Vortons, who accompany you along the highway. A key strategic element to the game is for the player character to travel several screens ahead of the bomb to clear a safe path for it; normally this would be done by temporarily blocking the bomb's forward motion. However, if the bomb is left in an unsafe location, it is possible for all your extra lives to be lost without the player character being destroyed once. Once all spare lives are lost, the player character must manually push the bomb.""";

It was developed by Microsoft Game Studios, produced and directed by Yukio Futatsugi, director of the critically acclaimed Panzer Dragoon for Sega Saturn. It was licensed for release in the U.S. by Majesco. Phantom Dust is a pseudo-card-based action/strategy game in which the player collects skills (over 300 total) and takes missions to attempt to discover why Earth is in the condition it is. Players construct \"arsenals\" (similar to decks of cards) from their acquired skills and then use them to battle against other players. The game incorporates strategy and action elements in to a game that requires both mental and reflexive skill.

The game remains a cult hit.

The Xbox Live servers no longer support Online Multiplayer for Phantom Dust, or any other Xbox Original game.""";

Ivoire consists of vast seas and numerous islands; it used to be a peaceful place, but an ancient (and powerful) force is now threatening life in the various lands. The character you control in the game is Marona, a 13 year old orphaned girl. Marona has the ability to communicate with phantoms, an ability that brings a lot of resentment from other people but will help her to head out into the world and solve the problems that are occurring. A phantom known as Ash acts as Marona's guardian; as the game progresses, other phantoms will join your party, each of which have different capabilities.

The game features a turn based combat system. During battles, Marona is able to attack enemies by herself, and she can also summon phantoms in her party to help out. To summon phantoms, you will need to confine them to an object on the screen (such as a rock or tree). Once confined to an object, you will then be able to control the phantom in battle, though phantoms only remain controllable for a limited number of turns. The object you confine a phantom to will affect it's abilities; for example, a rock may make a phantom stronger but move slower. By defeating enemies in battle you earn experience points allowing to level up and become more powerful.""";

It is a Fable in one way, but in the 'trick of the tale', it's a strange adventure through a shattered world and a saga born out of the very sick mind of a man called Ismael.

Long ago in the mists of time lived the Mecubarz. Ancient and beautiful, powerful and wise they ruled absolute. Strange beings, magical creatures and humans lived together in peace and harmony, until greed destroyed it all. Ismael, a respected man, and revered by all, sadly had a heart that was hollow and bitter. He and four others plotted to overthrow the Mecubarz.

The Mecubarz' fury at the treason of Ismael and his men was cataclysmic. They trapped the four seasons and put them into impenetrable crystals, casting them to the four corners of the shattered world where they stood still and were held in an eternal dominion of ice, mist, water, and fire. The four traitors were exiled, but Ismael disappeared.

As Quickthorpe, an inexperienced adventurer, your quest is to explore the Four Lands of the Mecubarz in search of the mystical gems that will liberate your people. Keen observation, puzzle-solving skill and quick thinking are the abilities required to undertake this exciting but unpredictable task. Interact with a universe of characters which come to life with true speech creating a world with an atmosphere so thick you can feel it. Combined stunning animations and atmospheric sound effects will ensure that Fable will take you on the journey of a lifetime!

You're ready to rock and roll but so is the enemy! They're waiting for you with combat helicopters of their own, backed up by radar-guided anti-aircraft guns and missiles and fixed wing aircraft. It's not going to be a cakewalk but you and your Apache are up to the challenge. Across four theaters of war-- Fort Hood where you train and then in war zones in Cyprus, Yemen, and Korea--you will fly the most fearsome helicopter that has ever been designed against enemies on land, sea, and air.

Apache Longbow took flying simulators to the next level. The developers constructed the flight model with fanatical attention to detail, going so far as to bring in Apache pilots to fly the in-game chopper and offer their feedback on how real the experience felt. Every flight simulator enthusiast will be pleased with the complexity and realism this game has to offer. Meanwhile, to make the game more accessible there is also an arcade mode where the flight mechanics aren't nearly as realistic, but there's still tons of fun to be had.

The download includes a Snake Eater theme, which included a FOX logo wallpaper, the theme song for the game, cursor sound effects from the Metal Gear series, and folders modeled after the cardboard boxes from the series. Both the digital download for the game itself as well as the 3DS theme were later released in both Europe and North America on December 18, with the game itself costing $19.99.

Jedoch war es zu Beginn geradezu gefüllt mit Bugs, was von der Spielergemeinde kritisiert wurde. Dennoch wurde es von den Anstoss-Fans mit Begeisterung aufgenommen, da es die wichtigsten Elemente von Anstoss 2 Gold enthielt und diese noch weiter vertiefen konnte.
Als besonders gelungen gilt die 3D-Spieldarstellung. Der Spieler konnte sich ein komplettes Spiel seines Teams reduziert auf neun Minuten ansehen. Auch der Szenenmodus galt als revolutionär, da die Szenen nicht, wie in den Vorgängerteilen, vorberechnet wurden. Kommentiert wurden die Spielszenen durch den bekannten Fußballkommentator Günther Koch.
Auch neu war die Umsetzung des Vereinsgeländes. Von Apfelbäumen über Konditionsparcours und Doping-Labor bis hin zu Wolkenkratzern konnte der Spieler sein Vereinsgelände mit Gebäuden, Gegenständen und Lebewesen mit und ohne Nutzen erweitern.
Mit der Veröffentlichung des finalen Patches auf Version 1.40 wurde es nahezu bugfrei und konnte die Anstoss-Spieler überzeugen. Insgesamt wurden bis heute über eine Million Exemplare von Anstoss 3 verkauft und machen es damit zu einem der erfolgreichsten PC-Spiele Deutschlands. Trotz seines Alters wird Anstoss 3 durch die große Spieltiefe zusammen mit einem gelungenen Text- und 3D-Modus als bester Teil der Anstoss-Reihe angesehen. Dass Anstoss 3 auch heute noch sehr beliebt ist, hängt auch mit dem Multiplayermodus zusammen. So wird es bis zu 4 Spielern ermöglicht, im Netzwerk gegeneinander anzutreten.""";

This game is the ninth release in North America, but despite having the same name as its Japanese counterpart, its gameplay and soundtrack is significantly different[1] and won the Video Music Awards in 2005 on MTV for Best Video Game Soundtrack.

While the PlayStation 2 version came out in North America, the arcade version was exclusive to Japan. Despite this, the arcade version was exported to many arcades in the USA (most of them being bootlegged). Dance Dance Revolution Extreme was the last game in the DDR arcade franchise for four years until Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova in 2006. The arcade release of the game contains one of the largest soundtracks of any DDR game, featuring 240 songs, as well as music from other Bemani music titles. Konami issued an in-game thank you to the fans of Dance Dance Revolution and announced a rejuvenation of the entire series, but did not go into details. Konami's announcement led people to believe that DDR Extreme might be the final DDR release or that the series might be on hiatus or rebooted in the same manner as Beatmania and Beatmania IIDX.""";
