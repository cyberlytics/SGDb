The consoles have two joysticks and six buttons on each stick and can interface with any ship that has been registered into it. Some PICCs also have LCD displays so that you don't need a TV to see what your PixelShip sees while it flies.\n\nEach PixelShip uses batteries, just like any other toy, though some use Micro-Reactors instead and are fueled at special facilities so that childeren cannot actually access the fuel inside. They are also designed out of segments held together by micro-magnets. When the ship is \"destroyed\" in combat, its micro-magnets disengage and the ship flies apart into its seperate segments, each still carrying a residual charge from the ship's anti-gravity unit. If all of the segments are then tagged by another PixelShip, that collector may then, under official guidelines, possess the ship if he so desires.\n\nClassic PixelShips takes place in the year 2076 when a very secretive PixelShip has supposedly been built. Your task is to collect all 160 known PixelShips by earning them through campaign battles at the arena. Afterwards, you will be given access to a special campaign where you may earn this unique and unheard of PixelShip.", "summary": "PixelShips is a side-scrolling 2D shooter consisting of randomly generated levels and missions.", "tags": [1, 18, 536871882, 536871971, 536876282, 536876391], "themes": [1, 18], "updated_at": 1635217542, "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pixelships", "checksum": "dd037221-7a76-ad10-e721-40551532be4b"}, {"id": 130740, "category": 0, "created_at": 1582329600, "external_games": [1617427, 1911867], "name": "Deathmatch Club", "slug": "deathmatch-club", "updated_at": 1598400000, "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/deathmatch-club", "checksum": "5feb0d25-b863-6e42-7dd0-8fe7da5d0141"}, {"id": 100789, "age_ratings": [21881], "category": 0, "created_at": 1525651200, "external_games": [679587, 679684, 1991025], "genres": [14, 33], "name": "Flying Arrow!.", "rating": 34.16185, "rating_count": 0, "similar_games": [14733, 87053, 90965, 109606, 116349, 116350, 116352, 116353, 120268], "slug": "flying-arrow--1", "summary": "Flying Arrow is a game control throw your arrow reach the remote target most.", "tags": [268435470, 268435489], "total_rating": 34.16185, "total_rating_count": 0, "updated_at": 1604620800, "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/flying-arrow--1", "websites": [78501], "checksum": "ecaba399-d6af-1a0a-5a4a-f1a08995382c"}, {"id": 85137, "artworks": [1843], "category": 0, "created_at": 1517356800, "external_games": [217493, 1946846], "first_release_date": 1253836800, "involved_companies": [60879], "name": "Family Trainer: Extreme Challenge", "platforms": [5], "release_dates": [139330], "screenshots": [158447, 158448, 158449, 158450, 158451, 158452, 158453, 158454, 158455, 158456, 158457, 158458], "slug": "family-trainer-extreme-challenge", "summary": "Family Trainer: Extreme Challenge is the follow up to the successful Family Trainer game/mat bundle.", "updated_at": 1604620800, "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/family-trainer-extreme-challenge", "checksum": "3fa9ceb4-794a-fd33-da5a-d54eb4cf9fe8"}, {"id": 176209, "artworks": [54775], "category": 0, "created_at": 1634289775, "external_games": [2134413], "genres": [10], "name": "YogKart", "screenshots": [662805, 662806, 662811, 662815, 662821, 662825], "similar_games": [43016, 44178, 47381, 80382, 103018, 104983, 107227, 109292, 120268, 190341], "slug": "yogkart", "summary": "Yogkart is a racing fangame set in the Yogscast universe.

It is fundamentally different from most solitaire games in that nearly all deals can be solved. Although software implementations vary, most versions label the hands with a number (derived from the random number seed used to generate the hand).\n\nRules\n\nConstruction and layout:\n\n* One standard 52-card deck is used.\n* There are four open cells and four open foundations. Some alternate rules use between one to ten cells.\n* Cards are dealt into eight cascades, four of which comprise seven cards and four of which comprise six. Some alternate rules will use between four to ten cascades.\n\nBuilding during play:\n\n* The top card of each cascade begins a tableau.\n* Tableaux must be built down by alternating colors.\n* Foundations are built up by suit.\n\nMoves:\n\n* Any cell card or top card of any cascade may be moved to build on a tableau, or moved to an empty cell, an empty cascade, or its foundation.\n* Complete or partial tableaus may be moved to build on existing tableaus, or moved to empty cascades, by recursively placing and removing cards through intermediate locations. While computer implementations often show this motion, players using physical decks typically move the tableau at once.\n\nVictory:\n\n* The game is won after all cards are moved to their foundation piles.\n\nFor games with the standard layout (four open cells and eight cascades) most games are easily solved.\n\nSupported Operations:\n* Tap one column and tap another column, move the cards from the first column to second column if possible;\n* Double Tap on the column's last card to move it to buffer area, if possible;\n* Drag cards from one column to another column, if possible;\n* Auto throw, cards will be throw to recycle automatically, if possible;\n* Drag from recycle to columns to restore the recycled card, if possible;\n\nWith Auto-throw, it is much more convenient to finish the card puzzle!\nEnjoy it, players!", "tags": [536873513, 536874083], "total_rating": 70.0, "total_rating_count": 0, "updated_at": 1604620800, "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/freecell-card-game", "websites": [71846], "checksum": "58620843-117d-7e6d-971a-1d24cfe6f998"}, {"id": 167697, "alternative_names": [72770], "category": 1, "created_at": 1631030083, "external_games": [2037088], "name": "Payday 2: The Election Day Heist", "parent_game": 2058, "screenshots": [609052, 609060, 609067, 609070, 609074, 609078, 609084, 609089, 609091], "similar_games": [25636, 100800, 103298, 103301, 103302, 106805, 112589, 113895, 115276, 120268], "slug": "payday-2-the-election-day-heist", "summary": "The Election Day Heist is the third free heist update to PAYDAY 2.

When the solar explosions died, the humans decide to return to Earth. When the Kat Men refuse to leave, a war droid known as MT-ED, or Multi Terrain Exploration Droid, is sent down to deal with the Kat Men. Accompanying him is Hercules 1, a maintenance and combat droid. When the two droids are beamed down, things take a turn for the worse. Hercules is kidnapped and taken far away to the Kat Men's Nerve Center. It is MT-ED's task to get rid of the Kat Men and rescue Hercules. \n \nTo do this, MT-ED has to explore fourteen environments and deal with deadly creatures that are within each environment, with each type of creature requiring a certain type of weapon to be defeated. These weapons - including lasers, water bombs, grenades, and rockets - can be picked up along the way, and MT-ED can switch between them with ease. If MT-ED comes into contact with any of the creatures, he is kicked into the air and gets stunned for a few seconds. If this happens, he loses one of his lives.

Players that enjoy replay value can expect around 70 possible decisions to explore, some of which will even influence Kazuki's \"romantic\" relationship with his female colleagues at Igrasil.\n\nAs for adult content in Bloody Chronicles, four unlockable episodes called \"IF mode\" are releasing soon and will feature Igrasil members Aki, Suzumi, Kaoru, and Akito.
